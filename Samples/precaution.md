# ⚠️ Precautions While Sharing Phishing Analysis Files

When analyzing or sharing phishing emails publicly (e.g., on GitHub, blogs, or reports), it is essential to follow responsible cybersecurity practices to protect your identity, your network, and others.

---

## 🔒 1. Remove Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

- Do not share your **email address**, **name**, or **organization** unless anonymized.
- Scrub any references to your IP address, location, or device metadata.

---

## 🛡️ 2. Obfuscate Malicious Links

- Never post **live phishing URLs**. Obfuscate them by replacing:
  - `http://` → `hxxp://`
  - `.` → `[.]`
- Example: `http://malicious-site.com` → `hxxp://malicious-site[.]com`

---

## 🧠 3. Avoid Sharing MAC or Local IP Addresses

- If you performed scans (e.g., Nmap, Wireshark), do **not share your MAC address or private IP** ranges (e.g., 192.168.x.x).
- Mask such addresses to prevent targeted attacks.

---

## ✅ 4. Follow Ethical Guidelines

- Only conduct scans or email header analyses on systems **you own or have permission to test**.
- Avoid interacting with live phishing sites unless in a **secure sandbox** or isolated VM.

---

## 📁 5. Label Your Samples Clearly

- Always indicate that your shared samples are **for educational use only**.
- Avoid uploading real attachments or executable payloads found in phishing emails.

---

## 🚫 6. Never Click Unknown Links

- Even for research, avoid clicking links from suspicious emails directly.
- Use tools like VirusTotal, URLScan, or sandboxed browsers for link analysis.

---

## 👨‍🏫 7. Attribution & Source Clarification

- If using publicly available phishing samples, cite your sources.
- Avoid claiming ownership of unknown threats or misattributing legitimate senders.
